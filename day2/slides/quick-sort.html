    Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data
    into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values small-
    er than specified value say pivot based on which the partition is made and another array holds
    values greater than pivot value.
